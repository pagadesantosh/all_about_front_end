    <p>
      In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that
      I've been turning over in my mind ever since.
      <q>Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,</q> he told me,
      <q>
        just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the
        advantages that you've had.
      </q>
    </p>
    <p>
      Reserving judgements is a matter of <i>infinite</i> hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something unique about Gatsby:
      <pre>
        He smiled understandingly-much more than understandingly. It was one of
        those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you
        may come across four or five times in life. It faced--or seemed to
        face--the whole eternal world for an instant, and then concentrated on
        you with an irresistible prejudice in your favor. It understood you just
        as far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like
        to believe in yourself, and assured you that it had precisely the
        impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to convey.
      </pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      “And as I sat there brooding on the old, unknown world, I thought of
      Gatsby’s wonder when he first picked out the green light at the end of
      Daisy’s dock. He had come a long way to this blue lawn, and his dream must
      have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it. He did not
      know that it was already behind him, somewhere back in that vast obscurity
      beyond the city, where the dark fields of the republic rolled on under the
      night.
      <u>Gatsby believed in the green light,</u> the orgastic future that year by
      year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter—to-morrow we
      will run faster, stretch out our arms farther. . . And one fine morning——
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>
        So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into
        the past.
      </em>
    </p>
    <p>
      <q>Life starts all over again when it gets crisp in the fall.</q>― F.
      Scott Fitzgerald, The Great Gatsby
