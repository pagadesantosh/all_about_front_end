- The details tag specifies the <strong>additional details that the user can open and close</strong> on demand

- The details tag is often used to create an interactive widget.

- By default the widget is <strong>closed</strong>

- When open, it expands and displays the content within.

<strong>allow-pointer-lock</strong> ---> API's are re-enabled
