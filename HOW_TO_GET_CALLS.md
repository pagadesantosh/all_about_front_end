1. Please have a look at my skills section
2. Have a look at my title, about summary description, certifications I did (relevant to my job profile)
3. Add featured Links (topmate links, add resume PDF(I removed), add a GitHub link)
4. Skill quiz (I have passed front-end development tech stack related to React skill quiz (you will see (check âœ…) symbol ex: Javascript) 
5. Recommendations section (get them added)
6. Your profile photo (should not be a selfie and it has to be in a blur background)
