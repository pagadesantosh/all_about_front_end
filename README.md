Note: Please make sure that there will be atleast one machine coding round for sure.

- You can prepare it on your own or have a look at my 43 solved machine coding challenges if you want to speed up the things. 
- I'm selling it for money due to the only reason that these challenges are developed with time constraint in mind. 
- You can easily complete any challenge on the given day in less than a hour and impress your interviewer.
