- I got Security violation from companies like GE Healthcare saying that I'm leaking their information (and I had to write down the 100 rupees bond notary for leaking information)

- This is pretty much common issue we can expect as we are supposed to not reveal any information by using any organisation name.

- And as the data grows day by day in our repository we will be much more vulnerable to Security Violations.

- This is the only reason I had to change the folder names to numbers.
