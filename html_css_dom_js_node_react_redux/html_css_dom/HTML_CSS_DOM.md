Instead of one option, we supply multiple. And you can think of it as a fallback system. If none of the five families we passed in are supported by the user browser at the end of the stack we can pass in generic Fonts family and the browser is going to use generic font family to get similar looking fonts.

## 24. Display vs opacity vs visibility in CSS

![alt text](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42731246/142733891-689b876d-380c-44e0-b5da-f4cb36334231.png)

#### <u>Use Cases of `display:none`</u>:

- Completely removing an element from the layout, especially **_in responsive designs where certain elements should not be shown at specific screen sizes_**.
- Used in JavaScript-driven interactions to hide or show elements dynamically (e.g., dropdown menus, modal dialogs).

### opacity:

- The opacity property **_controls the transparency level of an element_**.
- An element with opacity: 0; is fully transparent **_<u>but still occupies space in the layout and remains interactive</u>_** (e.g., clickable).

#### <u>Use Cases of `opacity:0`</u>:

- Creating fade-in/fade-out animations where an element gradually appears or disappears but should still occupy space during the transition.

### visibility:

- The visibility property determines whether an element is visible or not.
- Setting visibility: hidden; makes an element invisible, but unlike `display: none;`, the element still takes up space in the layout.
- It's invisible but still affects layout and document flow.

#### <u>Use Cases of `visibility:hidden`</u>:

- Temporarily hiding elements **_without disrupting the layout_**.
- Useful in cases **_where you might want to show the element again without having to recalculate the layout_** or where the sudden appearance/disappearance of elements could cause a jarring shift in the layout.
- Creating tool tips or dropdown menus that appear in the same spot without affecting the surrounding elements position.

**<u>When to Use Each:**</u>

- Use `display: none`; when you need to remove an element entirely from the layout and document flow. This is **_<u>useful for responsive designs or when replacing an element with another</u>_**.
  <br/>
- Use `opacity: 0`; **_<u>for creating visual effects where the element transitions from invisible to visible or vice versa, especially in animations</u>_**. This property is best when you want an element to remain part of the layout and document flow, even when it's not visibly seen.
  <br/>
- Use `visibility: hidden`; when you want to hide an element but maintain its space in the layout. This is **_<u>ideal for UI elements that toggle between being shown and hidden, where maintaining the layout's stability is crucial</u>_**.

## 25. Float and Clear in CSS

- The `float` and `clear` properties in CSS are tools **for controlling the layout** of elements on a webpage, **_<u>particularly how elements align horizontally</u>_** and how they interact with each other in terms of flow and positioning.

- Float is a CSS positioning property **_primarily used for wrapping text around images_** or (for creating layouts where block-level elements are aligned side by side)
- **_Floated elements remain a part of the flow of the page, and will affect the positioning of other elements_** (e.g. text will flow around floated elements), unlike `position: absolute` elements, which is used to position an element completely out of the normal document flow.
- The CSS `clear` property can be used to positioned below `left/right/both` floated elements
- If parent element contains nothing but floated elements, its height will be collapsed to nothing which can be fixed by clearing the float after the floated elements in the container but before the close of the container.
- **_Floats <u>don't provide vertical alignment_</u>**.

#### Float:

- is used to <u>place an element to the left or right side of its container</u>, allowing other content to wrap around it
- The values for float can be `left`, `right`, or `none`

##### <u>Use Cases:</u>

- Text wrapping around images: Making text wrap around an image by floating the image to the left or right.

#### Clear:

- The clear property is used to prevent elements from floating alongside or wrapping around an element.
- It can clear floats to the left, right, or both sides of an element, **_<u>ensuring that the element appears below floated elements previously defined in the markup</u>_**.

##### <u>Use Cases:</u>

- **Stopping text wrap:** **_<u>Forcing text or other elements to appear below</u>_** a floated element instead of wrapping around it.
- **Creating separation**: **_<u>Ensuring that a section of content starts on a new line</u>_**, clear of any floated elements that precede it.

## 26. Position Static vs Position relative

## 29. Z-index

- z-index `controls the vertical stacking order of elements` that overlap each other.
- z-index only affects `positioned elements` (elements which have a position value which is not `static`) and its descendants or flex items
- Can be of Positive or negative whole numbers, determining the elements layer within its stacking context.
- if provided auto, the element inherits its stacking order from its parent.
- Higher z-index values mean the element will be closer to the front, overlaying elements with lower values.
- If two elements have the same z-index, the one that appears later in the HTML will be on top.
- Negative values are allowed which can place elements behind their parent stacking context.

**Stacking context**:

- is an element that contains a set of layers.
- within a local stacking context, the z-index values of its children are set relative to that element rather than to the document root.

**Use cases:**

- For complex web designs where **_<u>elements like modals, dropdowns, tooltips, and overlays must float above other content</u>_**.

## 31. Descendant and Child selectors

**Overview:**

- `.header h1`: This is a `descendant` selector. It **_<u>selects any h1 element that is inside a .header element, regardless of the level of nesting</u>_**. Both h1 elements within the header class are targeted by this selector. The color green is applied to these h1 elements.
  <br/>
- `.header > h1`: This is a `child` selector. It **_selects h1 elements that are direct children of .header_**.
- This means **_<u>it will only apply to h1 elements that are immediately wrapped by a div with the class header, but not h1 elements that are nested further within other elements</u>_** (like inside the ul within the header class). The color purple is assigned to these h1 elements.
  <br/>
- `div h1`: This is another descendant selector, **_but it is less specific than the first one_**
  <br/>
- `div > h1`: This is another child selector, similar to the second rule, but it applies to h1 elements that are direct children of any div, **_not just ones with the class header_**.

## 34. root element

- #### A `:root` selector defines the base font size as 10px.

- Elements with the class .absolute will have a font size of 24px. (No change here because this is not relative to the root font size. )
- Elements with the class .relative will have a font size of 15px, **_because 1.5rem is multiplied by the root font size of 10px_**.

## 36. Animation

- The animation-fill-mode property in CSS **_<u>specifies how a CSS animation should apply styles to its target before and after its execution_</u>**.
  <br/>

- **none**: The default value. The **<u>_animation will not apply any styles to the target before or after it is executing_</u>**.
  <br/>
- **forwards**: **<u>_After the animation completes (i.e., it finishes playing), the target will retain the style values that were set by the last keyframe of the animation_</u>** (the keyframe that is applied when the animation ends). This is often used when you want the state of the animation to be preserved after it finishes.
  <br/>
- **backwards**: The **_<u>target will apply the style values defined in the first keyframe, and these values will be applied as soon as the animation is applied to the target_</u>** (even before the animation starts). This is useful if you want the initial state of the animation to take effect during the period defined by animation-delay.
  <br/>

  both: The target **_<u>will follow the rules for both forwards and backwards</u>_**. It will get the style values from the first keyframe when the animation is applied, and retain the style values from the last keyframe after the animation completes.

## 39. Flex vs Grid

The basic difference between `CSS Grid Layout` and `CSS Flexbox Layout` is that

- **_<u>flexbox was designed for layout in one dimension</u>_** - either` a row` or `a column`.

- Grid was **_designed for two-dimensional layout - rows, and columns at the same time_**

---

## 40. Position relative vs Position absolute

position: relative places an element relative to its current position without changing the layout around it, whereas position: absolute places an element relative to its parent's position and changing the layout around it.

---

## 41. What is CSS selector specificity and how does it work?

- The browser determines what styles to show on an element depending on the specificity of CSS rules.
- Four set of rules are calculated based on the following

```js
  a - is whether inline styles are being used.
  b - is ID selectors
  c - classes, attributes & pseudo classes selectors
  d - tags and pseudo-elements selectors

Ex: a, b, c, d
```

- In order to determine which has the highest specificity look from left to right (ex: 0 1 0 0) so b will override c and d in this case.
- In cases of equal specificity, the latest rule is the one that counts.
- If you have written the same rule into your stylesheet then the lower rule in your stylesheet is closer to the element to be styled.
- **It is a better practice to write CSS rules with low specificity so that they can be easily overridden if necessary without using too complicated CSS rules just for the sake of increasing specificity or resorting to !important**

---

## 42. What is the difference between "resetting" and "normalizing" CSS? Which would you choose, and why?

- **Resetting**: Is meant to strip all default browser styling on elements. For e.g. **margins, paddings, font-size** of all the elements are reset to be the same.
  You have to redeclare styling for common typographic elements.

- **Normalizing**: **_<u>Preserves useful default styles</u>_** rather than `unstyling` everything. It also corrects bugs for common browser dependencies.

```js
