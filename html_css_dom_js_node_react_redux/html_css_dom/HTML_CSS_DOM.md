Instead of one option, we supply multiple. And you can think of it as a fallback system. If none of the five families we passed in are supported by the user browser at the end of the stack we can pass in generic Fonts family and the browser is going to use generic font family to get similar looking fonts.

## 38. Box-shadow

## 39. Flex vs Grid

The basic difference between CSS Grid Layout and CSS Flexbox Layout is that flexbox was designed for layout in one dimension - either a row or a column. Grid was designed for two-dimensional layout - rows, and columns at the same time

## 40. Position relative vs Position absolute

position: relative places an element relative to its current position without changing the layout around it, whereas position: absolute places an element relative to its parent's position and changing the layout around it.

## 41. What is CSS selector specificity and how does it work?

- The browser determines what styles to show on an element depending on the specificity of CSS rules.
- Four set of rules are calculated based on the following

a - is whether inline styles are being used.
b - is ID selectors
c - classes, attributes & pseudo classes selectors
d - tags and pseudo-elements selectors

Ex: a, b, c, d

- In order to determine which has the highest specificity look from left to right (ex: 0 1 0 0) so b will override c and d in this case.
- In cases of equal specificity, the latest rule is the one that counts.
- If you have written the same rule into your stylesheet then the lower rule in your stylesheet is closer to the element to be styled.
- **It is a better practice to write CSS rules with low specificity so that they can be easily overridden if necessary without using too complicated CSS rules just for the sake of increasing specificity or resorting to !important**

---

## 42. What is the difference between "resetting" and "normalizing" CSS? Which would you choose, and why?

- **Resetting**: Is meant to strip all default browser styling on elements. For e.g. **margins, paddings, font-size** of all the elements are reset to be the same.
  You have to redeclare styling for common typographic elements.

- **Normalizing**: Preserves useful default styles rather than `unstyling` everything. It also corrects bugs for common browser dependencies.

---

## 43. Describe Floats and how they work.

- Float is a CSS positioning property primarily used for wrapping text around images or (for creating layouts where block-level elements are aligned side by side)
- Floated elements remain a part of the flow of the page, and will affect the positioning of other elements (e.g. text will flow around floated elements), unlike `position: absolute` elements, which is used to position an element completely out of the normal document flow.
- The CSS `clear` property can be used to positioned below `left/right/both` floated elements
- If parent element contains nothing but floated elements, its height will be collapsed to nothing which can be fixed by clearing the float after the floated elements in the container but before the close of the container.
- Floats don't provide vertical alignment.

---

## 44. Describe z-index and how stacking context is formed.
- z-index `controls the vertical stacking order of elements` that overlap each other.
- z-index only affects `positioned elements` (elements which have a position value which is not `static`) and its descendants or flex items
- Can be of Positive or negative whole numbers, determining the elements layer within its stacking context.
- if provided auto, the element inherits its stacking order from its parent.
- Higher z-index values mean the element will be closer to the front, overlaying elements with lower values.
- If two elements have the same z-index, the one that appears later in the HTML will be on top.
- Negative values are allowed which can place elements behind their parent stacking context.

**Stacking context**:
- is an element that contains a set of layers.
- within a local stacking context, the z-index values of its children are set relative to that element rather than to the document root.
