### Rendering:

- Is <u>any time a function component gets called **_which returns a set of instructions_**</u> for creating DOM.
- It may happen either through a state change or a prop change.

### Mounting:

- Is when **_react renders the component for the first time_** and actually builds the initial DOM from those instructions
- Mounting a react component means the actual addition of the DOM elements created by the react component into the browser DOM for the first time.

### Re-render:

- Is when **_React calls the function component again to get a new set of instructions_** on an already mounted component.
