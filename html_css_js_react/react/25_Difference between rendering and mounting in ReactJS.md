### Rendering:
- Is any time a function component gets called which returns a set of instructions for creating DOM.
- It may happen either through a state change or a prop change.

### Mounting:
- Is when ***react renders the component for the first time*** and actually builds the initial DOM from those instructions
- Mounting a react component means the actual addition of the DOM elements created by the react component into the browser DOM for the first time.

### Re-render:
- Is when React calls the function component again to get a new set of instructions on an already mounted component.
