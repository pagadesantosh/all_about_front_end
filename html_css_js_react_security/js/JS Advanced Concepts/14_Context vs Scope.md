### 14. Context vs Scope

**Scope**

- Scope is a **_function_** based
- Scope means what is the variable axis of a function when it is invoked and what is in the variable environment.

**Context**

- Context, on the other hand, is more about object based.
- Context says **_what's the value of the this keyword_**, which is a reference to the object that owns that current executing code.

**_Context is most often determined by how a function is invoked with the value of this keyword and scope
refers to the visibility of variables._**
