### 15. Javascript Data Types

**_There are 7 JS data types_**

```js
/* Primitives: types other than object type are all primitives (It is a data that only represents a single value)*/
- Number
- String
- Boolean
- undefined (absence of a definition for a variable)
- null (absence of value + intentionally provided value )

/* Non-primitives: Doesn't contain the actual value directly, whereas it has reference similar to a pointer to somewhere in memory that the object is held */
- Object
- Symbol (usually used for object properties so that their property is **_unique_**)
```

<b><u>Note:</u></b> typeof function(){} returns function but underneath the hood, **_functions are just objects_**

<b><u>Note:</u></b> Primitives are immutable (in order to change them, remove the primitive type and assign with a new value )
