- As we know that **_arrays and functions are nothing but objects_** in javascript.

- Javascript uses prototypical inheritance, By this means **_array object/function object gets access to their properties and methods_** of the object through this prototypical inheritance

###### There is a way to see this prototype chain (using double underscore proto)

**Arrays:**

**Object**
![image](https://github.com/saiteja-gatadi1996/interview_prep/assets/42731246/93e92558-2b2d-4e7d-84ed-5041c00d4f20)

<u>**Let's go through few examples:**</u>

```js
// Object 1
let dragon = {
  fire: true,
  name: 'Tanya',
  fight() {
    return 5;
  },
  sing() {
    return `I'm ${this.name}, the breather of fire`;
  },
};

console.log(dragon.fight()); //5
console.log(dragon.sing()); //I'm Tanya, the breather of fire
```

```js
// Object 2
let lizard = {
  name: 'Kiki',
  fight() {
    return 1;
  },
};
```

- Let's say if we **_wanted to borrow sing method_** from the dragon object, one of the way is to **_call/apply/bind_**

```js
let singLizard = dragon.sing.bind(lizard);
console.log(singleLizard()); // I'm Kiki, the breather of fire
```

- Above logic **_works totally fine for the object 1_**, but what if our dragon object gets a little more complicated

---

<u>**What if the object gets more complicated:**</u>

```js
// Updated Object 1, added if condition to the sing method
let dragon = {
  fire: true,
  name: 'Tanya',
  fight() {
    return 5;
  },
  sing() {
    if (this.fire) {
      return `I'm ${this.name}, the breather of fire`;
    }
  },
};
```

```js
// Object 2, as it was
let lizard = {
  name: 'Kiki',
  fight() {
    return 1;
  },
};
```

```js
//trying to bind to the updated dragon object
let singleLizard = dragon.sing.bind(lizard);
console.log(singleLizard()); // undefined

//because lizard object doesn't have fire property set to true
// even though we borrow the method, we don't have the fire accessibility in this case, so it is never going to be surpass if condition.
```

---

#### This is where prototypical inheritance comes in ðŸ˜Ž

- What if we create a prototype chain **_so that lizard(object 2) inherit all the properties and methods of dragon(object 1)_**

```js
// Updated Object 1, as per above
let dragon = {
  fire: true,
  name: 'Tanya',
  fight() {
    return 5;
  },
  sing() {
    if (this.fire) {
      return `I'm ${this.name}, the breather of fire`;
    }
  },
};
```

```js
// Object 2, as it was
let lizard = {
  name: 'Kiki',
  fight() {
    return 1;
  },
};
```

```js
lizard.__proto__ = dragon;
lizard.sing(); //"I'm Kiki, the breather of fire"
```

```js
lizard.fire; // true
```

```js
lizard.fight; // 1
```

**_What we were able to do here is, `inherit all the properties and methods of dragon object(Object 1)` + whatever the properties we define in our lizard(Object 2) will stay with us_**

```js
//isPrototypeOf is being checked in the Dragon Object prototype chain,
// does lizard inherit the properties from dragon?
dragon.isPrototypeOf(lizard); //true
```

---

<u>**Looping through the object:**</u>

```js
// Object 1
let dragon = {
  fire: true,
  name: 'Tanya',
  fight() {
    return 5;
  },
  sing() {
    if (this.fire) {
      return `I'm ${this.name}, the breather of fire`;
    }
  },
};

// Object 2, as it was
let lizard = {
  name: 'Kiki',
  fight() {
    return 1;
  },
};

lizard.__proto__ = dragon;

for (let prop in lizard) {
  console.log(prop);
}

// Output
name;
fight;
fire;
sing;
```

---

<u>**Looping through the object:**</u>

<b>`using hasOwnProperty`:</b>

```js
// Object 1, as it was
let dragon = {
  fire: true,
  name: 'Tanya',
  fight() {
    return 5;
  },
  sing() {
    if (this.fire) {
      return `I'm ${this.name}, the breather of fire`;
    }
  },
};

// Object 2, as it was
let lizard = {
  name: 'Kiki',
  fight() {
    return 1;
  },
};

lizard.__proto__ = dragon;

for (let prop in lizard) {
  //added if condition
  if (lizard.hasOwnProperty(prop)) {
    console.log(prop);
  }
}

// Output
name;
fight;
```

<u>**Note:**</u> Never use **_double underscore proto_** ðŸ˜„

<u>**Why Prototypical Inheritance is useful:**</u>

- The fact that objects can share prototypes means that you can have **_objects with properties & methods that are pointing to the same place in memory_**, thus being memory efficient.

- Instead of copying the same functionality in different places in memory, **_we have it in just at one place_**

<u>**One thing to remember is:**</u> **_double underscore proto_** property actually **_lives on the prototype_**

---

Safe way to create own prototypes is by using Object.create()

![image](https://github.com/saiteja-gatadi1996/interview_prep/assets/42731246/e281f985-1bd1-4516-a110-b0ad66fde5a4)

**_In Functions, The only time when we use prototypes is when we call constructor functions._**

- Constructor functions usually start with a capital letter and they contain the prototype that we use

![image](https://github.com/saiteja-gatadi1996/interview_prep/assets/42731246/c6aecbca-bc7b-49e1-8050-868d6c3f2091)

```js
typeof Object; //'function'
```

<u>**One thing to remember is:**</u> Every function has a prototype property and it references to an object used to attach properties that will be inherited by objects further down the prototype chain. The last object in the chain is this built in object (Object.prototype)

<u>**Another thing to remember is:**</u> **_Object_** is a function because it has the prototype and now Object.prototype is what we call the base object

**WHAT IS HAPPENING**

<u>**Summary:**</u>
Using prototypes, we avoid repeating ourselves. We avoid adding the same code over and over and over and being inefficient with our memory.

<u><b>Interview Question:</b></u> Difference between proto and prototype

`__proto__`:

- `__proto__` is a property of an object **_that points to the prototype of the constructor function_** which created that object.
- It is a part of the internal prototype chain that Javascript uses to look up properties and methods
- is the actual object that is used in the lookup chain to resolve methods
- Direct use of proto is discouraged, Instead the standard functions Object.setPrototypeOf and Object.getPrototypeOf are recommended

`prototype:`

- prototype is a **_property of a function object_**, <u>specifically a constructor function</u>, that is used to set the prototype of new objects created with that constructor function
- Ex: if you have a constructor function `MyConstructor`, MyConstructor.prototype will be the object that new instances created with new MyConstructor will have in their `__proto__`

```js
//Sample Code
function MyConstructor() {}

MyConstructor.prototype.addSomeFunc = function () {};

const newInstance = new MyConstructor();

console.log(newInstance.__proto__ === MyConstructor.prototype); //true
```
