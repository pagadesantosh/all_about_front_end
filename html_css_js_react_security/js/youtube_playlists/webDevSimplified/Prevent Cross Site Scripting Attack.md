- <strong>innerHTML</strong> is not a safe because if the user inputs valid HTML or script tag or an image tag, It'll render as actual HTML instead of as text.
- In order to get rid of this we can replace .innerHTML to <strong>.innerText</strong>
- If you really want to use innerHTML you need to make sure that nothing that goes to the innerHTML is sent you by the user unless you first escape that user input so essentially makes us that user input will render a <strong>string</strong> no matter what you do because you <strong>escape out all of the different HTML specific symbols</strong> so that it can no longer be rendered as HTML and must be rendered as text.
