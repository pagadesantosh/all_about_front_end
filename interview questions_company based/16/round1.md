### 2. Ecommerce site that has different components(header/footer/left nav/ right content) developed in different frameworks(react/angular/vue)
   - How will you design/develop
   - How can you communicate between the components
   - How can you use a common components(like a button) across different frameworks

<details>

### Design/Development:

1. **Micro Frontends Approach**: 
   - Utilize the micro frontends architecture, where each main component (header, footer, navigation, content) is developed and deployed as an independent application. 
   - This allows teams to work on each section using the most suitable framework for that component's needs.

2. **Web Components**: 
   - Implement Web Components for parts of the UI that are framework-agnostic. 
   - This encapsulates the styling and functionality, making them reusable across different frameworks.


3. **Module Federation or Iframes**: 
   - Tools like <ins>***Webpack's Module Federation can be used***</ins> to dynamically load separate components, even if they are built with different frameworks. 
   - Iframes can also be used as a last resort, but they are less favored due to performance and design limitations.

### Communication Between Components:

   1. **Custom Events**: 
      - For communication between components, custom events can be a viable option. When an action occurs in one component, it can dispatch an event that other components can listen for and react to.
   2. **Shared Global Store**: 
      - Implementing a global state management system like Redux or Vuex, or even the Context API in React, can provide a centralized store that is accessible to components regardless of the framework.
   3. **URL and Query Parameters:**
      - For simple state synchronization between components, URL and query parameters can be utilized, especially for navigation and content components that may rely on URL changes.


### Common Components Across Frameworks:

   1. **Build as Web Components**: 
      - Creating common UI elements like buttons as Web Components is one of the most effective methods to ensure compatibility across different frameworks. 
      - Web Components are based on web standards and can be integrated into React, Angular, Vue, or any other framework.
   2. **Use a Design System**: 
      - Implement a design system with a set of standards for design and code that includes common components. 
      - Tools like Storybook can be utilized to maintain this system and ensure that components have a consistent look and feel, as well as similar APIs across different frameworks.
   3. **CSS-in-JS Libraries**: 
      - Use CSS-in-JS libraries to style components. This can help in keeping a consistent style across components regardless of the framework, although it requires agreement on the library to be used across teams.

### 3. What are the different module systems

<details>

-  in JavaScript, a module system is a <ins>***mechanism that allows you to split your code into separate units, or modules, each with its own scope***</ins>, and then include them as needed. 
-  This approach enhances code organization, maintainability, and reusability. 

<ins>**CommonJS (CJS)**:</ins> 
   - Used mainly in Node.js for server-side development. 
   - It ***allows for synchronous loading*** of modules. 
   - Modules are **loaded using `require()`** and **exported using `module.exports`**.

<ins>**Asynchronous Module Definition (AMD):**</ins>

   - Used for ***asynchronous module loading***, suitable for browsers. 
   - It's implemented by libraries like `RequireJS`. 
   - Modules are defined using `define()` and dependencies are loaded asynchronously.


<ins>**Universal Module Definition (UMD):**</ins>

- Aims to provide compatibility with both CommonJS and AMD as well as with the traditional global variable method. 
- It checks the environment and adapts accordingly, allowing the module to be used in different contexts.

<ins>**ES Modules (ESM):**</ins>
  -  The standard module system in modern JavaScript, introduced with ES6 (ECMAScript 2015). 
  -  It supports static analysis and tree-shaking for more efficient bundling. Modules are imported using the `import` keyword and exported using `export`.

### 4. Unit testing - difference between mock/stub/spy


<details>

#### Mock:
- A mock is used to <ins>***verify interactions between methods***</ins> and ***integrates rules about how they are supposed to be called***. 
- <ins>**It can be set up with expectations**:</ins> methods that should be called, the order of calls, the parameters they are called with, etc. 
- If the expectations are **not** met, the mock will typically cause the test to **fail**.
- Useful in scenarios <ins>***where the interaction itself is what needs to be tested***</ins>, not just the output.


```js
// FUNCTION TO TEST
// logger.js
function logIfTrue(value) {
  if (value) {
    console.log('Value is true!');
  }
}
```

```js
// TEST USING A MOCK:
// logger.test.js
import { logIfTrue } from './logger';

test('should log message when value is true', () => {
  // Spy on console.log
  const logMock = jest.spyOn(console, 'log');
  logMock.mockImplementation(() => {});

  logIfTrue(true);

  expect(logMock).toHaveBeenCalledWith('Value is true!');
  logMock.mockRestore(); // Restore the original implementation
});
```
----

#### Stub:
- Stubs primarily ***serve to provide <ins>predefined responses to function calls***</ins> that are necessary for the unit test to run. 
- They typically <ins>***don't record information about calls***</ins>.
- Useful in scenarios where you just need <ins>***to make sure that a piece of code can handle the input and produce the correct output***</ins> without really caring about the interaction with the dependency
  
```js
// FUNCTION TO TEST
// user.js
async function getUser(id) {
  return fetch(`https://api.example.com/users/${id}`)
    .then(response => response.json());
}
```

```js
// TEST USING A STUB
// user.test.js
import { getUser } from './user';

// Jest allows us to mock functions in this way
jest.mock('node-fetch', () => jest.fn());

const fetch = require('node-fetch');

test('should return user data', async () => {
  const fakeUser = { id: 1, name: 'Saiteja Gatadi' };
  fetch.mockImplementation(() => Promise.resolve({
    json: () => Promise.resolve(fakeUser)
  }));

  const userData = await getUser(1);
  expect(userData).toEqual(fakeUser);
});
```
----

#### Spy:
- A spy <ins>***records some information based on how its methods were called***</ins>.
- This can <ins>***include tracking how many times methods were called, with what arguments they were called***</ins>, and so forth. 
- Unlike mocks, spies generally **do not allow you to set expectations before the code runs**; they record information about interactions to be asserted later.

```js
// FUNCTION TO TEST
// calculator.js
class Calculator {
  add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
  }
}
```

```js
// TEST USING A SPY:
// calculator.test.js
import Calculator from './calculator';

test('should call add method correctly', () => {
  const calc = new Calculator();
  const spy = jest.spyOn(calc, 'add');
  const result = calc.add(2, 3);

  expect(spy).toHaveBeenCalledWith(2, 3);
  expect(result).toBe(5);
  spy.mockRestore(); // Restore original method
});
```
----

### Summary
- **Stub**: Provides ***predefined responses***, doesnâ€™t record anything.
- **Mock**: <ins>***Set up with expectations beforehand***</ins>, and the test fails if the expectations aren't met.
- **Spy**: Similar to a stub but also ***records information about how it was called***, which can be checked after the test execution.

### 5. State management 

<details>

- React has its **built-in** state management capabilities, but as applications grow in complexity, developers often turn to **external libraries** to simplify and enhance the process.

#### 1. Local State Management (useState):

```js
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
---

#### 2. Lifting state up:

- When **multiple** components need to share and modify the **same state**, you can lift the state up to their **closest common ancestor**.

```js
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <>
      <ChildComponent count={count} setCount={setCount} />
      <AnotherChild count={count} />
    </>
  );
}

function ChildComponent({ count, setCount }) {
  return (
    <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
      Increment
    </button>
  );
}

function AnotherChild({ count }) {
  return <p>Count: {count}</p>;
}
```
----

#### 3. Context API:

- For more global state needs, React **provides** the Context API, which allows you to share values across the entire component tree **without having to explicitly pass props** at every level.

```js
import React, { createContext, useContext, useState } from 'react';

const CountContext = createContext();

function CounterProvider({ children }) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const value = { count, setCount };
  
  return (
    <CountContext.Provider value={value}>
      {children}
    </CountContext.Provider>
  );
}

function App() {
  return (
    <CounterProvider>
      <ChildComponent />
      <AnotherChild />
    </CounterProvider>
  );
}

function ChildComponent() {
  const { count, setCount } = useContext(CountContext);
  return (
    <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
      Increment
    </button>
  );
}

function AnotherChild() {
  const { count } = useContext(CountContext);
  return <p>Count: {count}</p>;
}
```

#### 4. External State Management Libraries

- **Redux**: 
  - provides a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. 
  - It helps you manage state globally and keep changes predictable and traceable

- **MobX**:
  - offers a more **flexible approach** to state management based on observable state objects. 
  - It is particularly useful for **complex states with many interdependencies**.

- **Recoil**:
   - developed by Facebook that provides several capabilities similar to Redux but with a simpler API and better integration with React's own capabilities.

- **Zustand**:
   - A minimalistic state management solution that uses hooks to provide a straightforward and intuitive way to manage global state across your app

### 6. Explain Redux flow, 
   - how to handle async actions, 
   - code example with 2 parents one child, 
   - how store updates the values, 
   - redux middleware

<details>


#### The Redux flow follows a strict unidirectional pattern:

1. **Action**: 
      - Actions are `payloads` of information that **send data from your application to your Redux store**. 
      - They are the <ins>***only source of information for the store***.</ins> 
      - You send them to the store using `store.dispatch()`.
<br/>

2. **Reducer**: 
   - Reducers specify <ins>***how the application's state changes in response to actions sent to the store***</ins>. 
   - Remember that reducers **are pure functions** that take the previous state and an action, and return the next state.
<br/>

3. **Store**: The `store` brings actions and reducers together. The store has the following responsibilities:

   - Holds application state;
   - Allows access to state via getState();
   - Allows state to be updated via dispatch(action);
   - Registers listeners via subscribe(listener);
   - Handles un-registering of listeners via the function returned by subscribe(listener).
<br/>

#### <ins>Handling Async Actions:</ins>

Redux by itself handles only synchronous actions. To work with asynchronous operations (like API requests), you need to use middleware such as redux-thunk or redux-saga.


- `Redux-Thunk` allows you to write <ins>**action creators that return a function**</ins> instead of an `action`. 
  - The thunk can be used to delay the dispatch of an action, or to dispatch only if a certain condition is met.


#### Example with Redux-Thunk:
- a simple example involving **two parent** components and **one child** component, using `Redux` for state management and `Redux-Thunk` for asynchronous actions.

<ins>**Setup**:</ins>

- Parent1 and Parent2 both display data.
- Child updates the data asynchronously.

```js
// actions.js
export const fetchDataSuccess = data => ({
  type: 'FETCH_DATA_SUCCESS',
  payload: data
});

export const fetchData = () => {
  return dispatch => {
    fetch('/some-api')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => dispatch(fetchDataSuccess(data)))
      .catch(error => console.error('Fetching data failed', error));
  };
};
```


```js
// reducer.js
const initialState = {
  data: null
};

function appReducer(state = initialState, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'FETCH_DATA_SUCCESS':
      return { ...state, data: action.payload };
    default:
      return state;
  }
}

export default appReducer;
```

```js
// store.js
import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux';
import thunk from 'redux-thunk';
import appReducer from './reducer';

const store = createStore(
  appReducer,
  applyMiddleware(thunk)
);

export default store;
```
```js
// Parent1.js
import React from 'react';
import { useSelector } from 'react-redux';

function Parent1() {
  const data = useSelector(state => state.data);
  return <div>Data in Parent1: {data}</div>;
}

export default Parent1;

// Parent2.js
import React from 'react';
import { useSelector } from 'react-redux';

function Parent2() {
  const data = useSelector(state => state.data);
  return <div>Data in Parent2: {data}</div>;
}

export default Parent2;

// Child.js
import React from 'react';
import { useDispatch } from 'react-redux';
import { fetchData } from './actions';

function Child() {
  const dispatch = useDispatch();

  return (
    <button onClick={() => dispatch(fetchData())}>
      Load Data
    </button>
  );
}

export default Child;
```

#### Redux Middleware:
  - `Middleware` in Redux is a way to **enhance the dispatch function**. 
  - Middleware can intercept every action sent to the store, then modify it, log it, delay it, ignore it, or perform other tasks before passing the action to the root reducer. 
  - This is crucial for handling side effects such as data fetching, as seen with redux-thunk.

#### Store Updates:

  - When an action is dispatched, the **Redux store's reducer calculates** the `new state` and ***replaces*** the `old state`. 
  - All listeners registered via subscribe are notified to re-render the React components based on the new state, maintaining a reactive data flow.
