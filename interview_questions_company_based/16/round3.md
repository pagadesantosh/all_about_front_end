### 10. how to manage state globally without using redux (useContext and useReducer)

#### Step 1: Define Your Context
```js
import React, { createContext, useReducer } from 'react';

// Initial state
const initialState = {
  count: 0,
};

// Create context
const GlobalContext = createContext(initialState);

// Reducer function
const reducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'INCREMENT':
      return { ...state, count: state.count + 1 };
    case 'DECREMENT':
      return { ...state, count: state.count - 1 };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

// Context Provider component
const GlobalProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);

  return (
    <GlobalContext.Provider value={{ state, dispatch }}>
      {children}
    </GlobalContext.Provider>
  );
};

export { GlobalContext, GlobalProvider };
```

#### Step 2: Create a Component to Use the Global State
```js
import React, { useContext } from 'react';
import { GlobalContext } from './GlobalState';

const Counter = () => {
  const { state, dispatch } = useContext(GlobalContext);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Count: {state.count}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' })}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'DECREMENT' })}>Decrement</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Counter;
```

#### Step 3: Set Up Your App Component
```js
import React from 'react';
import { GlobalProvider } from './GlobalState';
import Counter from './Counter';

function App() {
  return (
    <GlobalProvider>
      <div>
        <h1>Welcome to the Counter App</h1>
        <Counter />
      </div>
    </GlobalProvider>
  );
}

export default App;
```

   - past experience with Micro-frontend and how you used to pass data between MFE's
   - questions on designing and how you divide a website into different components and why
   - if you want develop your company website using MFE how many MFE will you create and why?
   - how to optimize the loading time of an MFE

### 12. As redux is third party library which will take time to load compared to context(as it is built in). why you choose redux why not context

#### 1. Performance and Optimization
- **Redux**: 
  - `Optimized` for frequent updates and complex state interactions across large applications. 
  - Redux **uses a single immutable state tree**, which can be more efficient at scale because components subscribe only to the parts of the state they need. 
  - This <ins>**minimizes unnecessary re-renders**</ins>.
<br/>

- **Context API**: 
  - Suitable **for simpler or medium-scale applications**, but it can lead to performance bottlenecks in larger apps. 
  - When a context value changes, **<ins>all components consuming that context will re-render, regardless of whether the change affects them**</ins>.


#### 2. Middleware and Enhancements
- **Redux**: 
  - Supports middleware, allowing for features like `logging`, `crash reporting`, performing asynchronous tasks, and more. 
  - Middleware like `Redux Thunk` and `Redux Saga` can <ins>**handle side effects</ins> in a more manageable way**.
<br/>

- **Context API**: 
   - `Lacks` built-in middleware support, **making it less suitable for complex** asynchronous logic or other middleware-driven enhancements unless supplemented by additional libraries or custom code.
#### 3. Developer Tools and Ecosystem
- **Redux**: 
  - Has a robust set of tools, most notably the **Redux DevTools**, which allow developers 
  - to track every state change, 
  - travel through time by inspecting each action, 
  - and re-evaluate state. 
<br/>

- **Context API**: 
  - While it's simpler and integrated directly into React, it **doesnâ€™t** have a comparable set of tools **for debugging** and `lacks` the extensive ecosystem of libraries and plugins available for Redux.

#### 4. Community and Resources
- **Redux**: 
  - Benefits from a large community and a wealth of resources, including tutorials, best practice guides, and third-party libraries. 
  - This can accelerate development and troubleshooting.
<br/>

- **Context API**:  
  - Although well-documented in the React docs, the patterns and practices around Context **are less standardized than Redux**, which can lead to inconsistent implementations across different projects.

#### 5. Predictability and Structure
- **Redux**: 
   - Enforces strict patterns and workflows, such as defining reducers and actions, which can help in maintaining a large codebase at scale. 
   - It **provides** a <ins>more predictable state management model</ins> through controlled updates.
<br/>
  
- **Context API**:  
   - Offers more flexibility, but without the enforced structure of Redux, which can lead to varied implementations and **potentially less predictable code.**
  
#### 6. Scalability
- **Redux**: 
   - Its architecture and ecosystem are <ins>**designed to scale smoothly as the application grows**</ins>. 
   - This makes it a <ins>**preferred choice</ins> for enterprise-level applications**.
<br/>
  
- **Context API**:  
   - **Best for smaller applications** or specific areas within an app where global state is overkill. Scaling can introduce performance issues as the number of context consumers grows.

#### Conclusion
- For `small` to `medium-sized` applications, especially those built as part of learning projects or **where the state is relatively straightforward**, ***React's Context API*** might be <ins>**more than sufficient**</ins> and easier to integrate. 
- However, for **`large-scale` applications with `complex state` interactions**, frequent updates, and a need for fine-grained performance optimizations, `Redux` or similar state management libraries <ins>**remain a strong choice**</ins> despite the initial overhead.
