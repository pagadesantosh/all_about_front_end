## Problem:

Part-1: Create 2 mock API’s which returns a list of students and each student has a name, some marks and a unique registration ID. Data from the 2 API’s can have common students i.e. mock API 1 can have a student as — ABC / 98% / 1234 (name / marks / registration ID) and this same data can be there in mock API 2 response as well. Now after creating these 2 API’s using Promises and hard-coded data, you need to merge the data coming from both API’s and have to delete the duplicates.

Part-2: Use the above data and render it in Box 1. Each student has a checkbox before its name and we can select multiple students at once. All the selected students can be moved to Box 2 by clicked on the 1st button and vice-versa for Box-2.
