### YouTube scalability methods from their early days,

Here's a summary of what I learned:

- They had a simple tech stack and used proven technologies

- They outsourced problems and focused on critical things

- They constantly identified bottlenecks and fixed them

- They traded off efficiency for scalability

- They kept a small and cross-disciplinary team for high productivity

- They used a multi-level cache to scale reads

- They focused on the high availability of critical components

- They added jitter to prevent the thundering herd problem

Also I wrote a detailed post with visuals of this case study in my newsletter.
