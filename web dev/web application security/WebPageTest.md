- WebPageTest is an online web tool that is well known for performance testing.
- It is not considered as a security penetration tool but does <strong>reveal the status of HTTP security headers employed by a website and detect vulnerable JS libraries.</strong>

- This tool is one of the most popular tools in Web Performance community to provide the following things:

```js
- Page Speed Insights
- bottleneck breakdown reports
- further info on website's performance
```

- A relatively recent addition to WebPageTest is that <strong>it provides users with security insights as to the status of HTTP security headers</strong> and detects vulnerable JS libraries that are rendered in scanned web pages.

#### Running a Scan

Head over to https://webpagetest.org and enter the URL for a web page of your preference.

#### Testing the Results

- Top-page scores
- Browser performance metrics such as

```js
- First-Byte,
- First Contentful Paint,
- Total Blocking Time,
- Document Complete
- Fully Loaded
- Waterfall for all the requests. This should be similar to the browser DevTools
```

#### Security Score

- You will be seeing Alphabets from A, B, E, F

```js
To remediate the security vulnerability and low score, one would simply need to upgrade to the latest version of these libraries which include a fix for the security vulnerability
```
