## Hi team,

## In no time, we have grown our team to include 80 developers, and this number is increasing day by day.

## My humble request is for everyone to help each other and grow in their careers. This can only be possible <ins>if you share the interview questions that you encountered in your recent interviews</ins>.

## Steps to be followed: 
- **Take a `clone` of my github repo**
- **create a `new` branch**
- **create a file with `.md` extension and write down the interview questions**
- **add a salary bracket and the position (junior/senior/lead)**
- **create a `Pull Request` (PR) towards master branch**
- **you would see me as a `codeowner`**
- **I'll `review` and `approve`**

## If you prefer not to mention the company name, you can refer to it as a service, product, or startup company.
