- **Will be writing down the answers to each and every interview question to make `your` and `my` life easier going forward for following.**

- For every answer that I'm trying to write, I have to try to write down as effective as possible with enough research and the most important thing is to impress my interviewer with the way I can explain the things.
- So, this is the reason you see me writing down lengthy answers for few of the questions. 
- Sometimes if interviewer is on mood they won't ask you 50 questions by expecting a single line answer, they can just ask 2 to 3 questions and expect how much depth you have on a particular topic (ex: design patterns/SOLID principles)
